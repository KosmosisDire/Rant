/* dart_shm: zero-copy same-host payload path. OPT-IN -- nothing here compiles or
 * links unless you define DART_SHM, so embedded / non-SHM targets carry zero cost
 * and need no shared-memory platform support. Speaks only dart_plat_* (shm mapping,
 * host uuid, an atomic for the generation stamp).
 *
 * Model (per-peer, inside the transport's reliable stream -- NOT a side topic).
 * A published message occupies count seqnos on the writer's per-topic line, as
 * today. The per-peer LANE picks the wire form:
 *   - remote peer  -> count DATA fragments, read from the message buffer (as now)
 *   - same-host peer-> ONE SHM-DATA submessage (a DATA flag) covering [base,count),
 *                      carrying a 24-byte descriptor (segment+chunk+gen+len); the
 *                      reader marks the whole range delivered and reads the chunk
 *                      in place (zero copy), then ACKs the range like any reader.
 * The shared seqno line is untouched, so a topic serves local and remote
 * subscribers at once (and multicast: group-multicast to remote, unicast SHM-DATA
 * to each local sub). Eligibility is automatic: a lane uses SHM iff that peer is
 * same-host and attached.
 *
 * Lifecycle reuses reliability, so there is NO separate refcount/reclaim protocol:
 *   - the chunk IS the writer's history slot's buffer (one chunk per keep_last slot)
 *   - the reader delivers SYNCHRONOUSLY (on_message reads the chunk in place) and only
 *     THEN arms its ACK, which leaves on a later poll_send -> an ACK provably means
 *     "the user finished reading." The writer holds the chunk until that ACK.
 *   - so the writer recycles a slot only when the reader ACKED (done) or discovery
 *     declared it dormant/gone (a live reader mid-read is announcing, never dormant).
 *     SHM eviction is gated on ACK-or-LIVENESS, NOT the short backpressure_wait_us
 *     timer -- a slow-but-alive reader applies backpressure instead of having its
 *     chunk yanked mid-read. That is the torn-free guarantee for RELIABLE SHM.
 *   - generation is the backstop: a straggler that reads a reused chunk sees a
 *     generation mismatch and counts the message lost (repaired on reliable, dropped
 *     on best-effort) instead of delivering torn bytes. Best-effort SHM has no ACKs,
 *     so a too-slow reader misses lapped messages, exactly like best-effort UDP.
 *   - contract: the on_message pointer is valid FOR THE CALL ONLY (already true for
 *     UDP); consume or copy it there. SHM just makes honoring it matter for safety.
 *
 * Zero copy both ways: the app loans a chunk and writes into it (dart_node_loan),
 * remote peers fragment straight from that chunk, local peers read it in place in
 * on_message (valid-for-the-call, the existing contract). One-copy fallback:
 * plain dart_topic_send memcpys into the chunk.
 *
 * Read modes (a future toggle; ship the safe one first):
 *   - ONE-COPY SHM (default): the reader memcpys the chunk into its own assembly buffer, then
 *     OWNS the bytes -- so it acks like UDP (ack timing is free, no deliver-before-ack
 *     coupling), the writer is released immediately, and there is no slow-reader stall
 *     or torn-read window. Still a big win: one SHM-DATA submessage + one local bulk
 *     copy replaces N fragment datagrams + reassembly.
 *   - ZERO-COPY SHM (opt-in): no copy, on_message reads the chunk in place; REQUIRES
 *     deliver-before-ack and holds the writer until the read completes (see below).
 *     The last increment, for latency/throughput-critical paths that accept the
 *     coupling. The difference is purely read-side: same wire format, same descriptor.
 *
 * This header is the portable mapping + chunk module. Its hooks into the transport
 * (the SHM-DATA submessage, the per-peer lane choice, chunk-backed history) and the
 * node (advertise, attach, deliver) are the contract in "INTEGRATION" below.

 *   - SHM-DATA submessage: byte0 = DATA | DART_F_SHM, [index][base seqno][count]
 *     [24-byte descriptor]. Writer lane emits it for an SHM peer instead of frags;
 *     reader marks [base,base+count) delivered, hands the descriptor up flagged.
 *   - delivery carries an "is SHM descriptor" flag to the node (the public app
 *     on_message is unchanged; the node wraps it -- see below)
 *
 * node (wiring):
 *   - advertise: meta blob -> ver 3, insert [u8 shm][u8 host[16]][u64 segment_id]
 *     between the frag prefix and the interest list (ver-2 peers ignore it)
 *   - on peer up: if peer.shm and host matches ours, i_dart_shm_attach its segment and
 *     set peer_shm in the transport; on down/dormant, detach / clear it
 *   - dart_node_loan(n, topic, len, &ptr) / dart_node_publish(n, topic): loan a chunk for
 *     the topic's next history slot, app fills ptr, publish hands the chunk +
 *     descriptor to the transport. dart_topic_send keeps working (one-copy into the
 *     chunk when the topic has any SHM peer, else plain inline)
 *   - on receive: the node's on_message wrapper sees the SHM flag, i_dart_shm_read the
 *     descriptor, calls the app on_message with the in-place pointer
